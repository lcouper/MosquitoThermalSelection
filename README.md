 ### Reference genome assembly ###
 
Issue with high duplication in assembly (Busco duplication >90%)
 Running purge_haplotigs to identify and purge_haplotigs
 But only finding one peak in coverage histgoram so unsure what to set as the cutoffs. Tried: -l 1 -m 25 -h 195
 
 Simultaneously trying to run BUSCO on just the UL assembly to see if duplication here is lower
