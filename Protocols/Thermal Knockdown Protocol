Thermal knockdown protocol

Following details outlined in Mitchell et al. (2011) and var Heerwaarden et al. (2012)

1. Set water bath to 28째C
2. Place adult in individual 5-mL plastic vial and submerge fully in water bath. Allow 15 minutes for acclimation
3. After 15 minutes, increase water bath temperature at a rate of 0.5째C per minute (Jorgenson and Overgaard, 2019) until temperature reaches 38째C
4. Observe individuals for 'knockdown': when an individaul loses muscle function and can no longer right themselves from a dorsal position
5. Immediately at the point of knockdown: record time, remove individuals from the tube and place in an individual PCR tube. Store at -80째C.

Not we peformed this protocol on adult Ae. sierrensis that had eclosed 48 - 72 hours prior and had not been sugar or blood-fed.
We performed all assays on eight adults at a time with the same, single observer for each assay
