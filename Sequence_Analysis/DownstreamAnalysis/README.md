## Downstream sequence analysis
*Pertains to analysis performed in R, after genotype matrix was created*

1. Visualize overall differences between treatment groups using PCA 


datasub = read.csv("GenotypeMatrix_Subset.csv‚Äù)[-1]
# center and scale genotype matrix
datasubM = as.matrix(datasub)
datasubMS = scale(datasubM, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
# get data into pcadapt-readable format
pcadata = read.pcadapt(t(datasubMS)) 
screetest <- pcadapt(input=pcadata,K=20) # K = # of principal components to retain
plot(screetest,option="screeplot") # Looks like ~5 is the correct number to retian
x = pcadapt(input= pcadata, K=5)

# Plot PCA: Heat-selected vs control 
plot(x,option="scores", pop=Treatment, 
     col = c("#00AFBB",  "#FC4E07")) + theme_bw() + ggtitle(label = NULL)
