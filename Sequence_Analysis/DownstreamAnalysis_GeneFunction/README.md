# Steps for gene function prediction 
Gene function predictions were obtained through NCBI BLASTN search
The start and stop positions of each gene were determined through braker (see DownstreamAnalysis_GeneAnnotation) and are listed in the file: GeneList_AllApproaches.csv

To identify 
samtools faidx asierrensis.scaffolded.fasta 1_RagTag:372060-374060
